# go-concurrency-examples

A **hands-on collection of Go concurrency examples**.  
This repository contains small, self-contained programs that demonstrate Goâ€™s concurrency primitives â€” goroutines, channels, synchronization, timeouts, and more.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Simple, focused examples of Go concurrency
- Covers goroutines, channels, select statements, timeouts, and sync primitives
- Easy to run and experiment with
- Useful as a reference or learning resource
